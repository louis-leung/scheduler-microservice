# Overview
This is a scheduler microservice API that deals with dynamic interactions between Tasks and Task Consumers and the generation of a scheduling policy at a given point in time. It is comprised of a Spring Boot application (backed by MongoDB) and a Spring Cloud Config Server.

## Config Server
1. You must launch the config server before running the Application.
To run:
    - ``` cd scheduler-microservice-cloud-config ```
    - ``` mvn spring-boot:run ```

The config server is now launched on ```http://localhost:8090``` and pulling `.properties` files from my Github at https://github.com/louis-leung/scheduler-microservice

## Application
1. Start up a MongoDB instance on localhost listening on default port 27017.

2. Now we can run the application.
To run:
    - ``` cd scheduler-microservice```
    - ``` mvn spring-boot:run ```

3. Navigate to ```http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html``` for Swagger API documentation and usage.

To refresh configuration, make a POST request to ```http://localhost:8090/actuator/refresh```

### Testing
The test suite uses the ```scheduler-microservice-test.properties``` profile and creates a separate database called SchedulerMicroserviceDBTest for its integration tests.
- ``` cd scheduler-microservice```
- ``` mvn test```



#### Assumptions:
1. A consumer won't query for more tasks until it has finished all the tasks it has been assigned.
2. Task due dates are entered in local time.

#### Issues and Resolutions: 
1. Concurrency: 
    1. What happens if two consumers query for tasks simultaneously? 
    - As of MongoDB 3.2, the WiredTiger storage engine is used and by default enables optimistic concurrency control. So if two consumers query at the same time, one query will incur a write conflict causing MongoDB to transparently retry the operation. 
    
#### Future Improvements:
- Make POSTing of tasks through response body not query params
- The integration tests currently only test for correct JSON payload of the object created as opposed to the entire Resource wrapper (with links). This is due to some object mapper conflicts that I haven't resolved yet. 
- Not complete code coverage on tests.
- Some form of authentication. (e.g. access token)
